# MCSRAI, Minecraft Speedrunning, powered by AI.

We are trying to speedrun Minecraft from spawning in to killing the Ender Dragon in 1.16.1 Minecraft Java edition.

We use MineRL, a rich package, which allows us to interact with Minecraft through an OpenAI Gym, as well as Mine Dojo, a pre-existing library used for Minecraft AI.
