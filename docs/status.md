## Project Summary

    Our goal has shifted from getting an agent to speedrun Minecraft, eventually seeing the end credits scene after defeating the ender dragon, to being able to enter the nether.

    So far, given the materials, our agent has been able to build the nether portal frame, light it, and enter the nether. 

    However, we want this agent to be able to spawn in a world and be able to enter the nether itself. Given that we were able to achieve the building of the portal, our current objective is to get the agent to navigate and build the portal from a set seed. 

    We chose to focus on a set seed as we think it would be simpler to allow it to converge on a "best" solution, but we plan to attempt random seeds as well.

## Approach

## Evaluation

    Currently, we are evaluating our agents on time, the faster the time, the better the agent.
